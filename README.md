# Excel-Porfolio-Projects

Description: The project entails comprehensive tracking and analysis of dress sales from an online store operating across various e-commerce platforms throughout India, encompassing all states and catering to diverse age groups. The primary objective is to develop an interactive dashboard within Excel, facilitating the extraction of valuable insights from the store's historical sales data.

Tasks:

•	Conducted data cleansing procedures to ensure data accuracy, including error removal, age grouping, conversion of all strings to proper case for enhanced readability, and elimination of duplicate entries.

•	Employed pivot table analysis techniques to examine and derive valuable insights from the dataset.

•	Utilized advanced Excel functions such as IF, SWITCH, and CONCAT for performing calculations within the interactive dashboards.

•	Developed an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive summary of the dataset, presenting meaningful insights that can be leveraged for informed decision-making.

Insights:
1. Amazon outperforms its succeeding competitor more than 50% in sales
2. There was a 12% decline in sales over the year. Highest sales was recorded in the month of March.
3. Adults in the age group of 30 to 49 contribute to half of the sales.
4. Women account for 70% of the overall order distribution, potentially attributed to the extensive range of available choices.
5. The recorded average revenue per order of 744 with an average of adding one product to the shopping cart
6. Maharashtra has high sales overall
7. In the context of an online clothing store, an average product per order ranging from 1.5 to 2 would generally be considered decent. This implies that customers are adding more than one item to their shopping carts, indicating a higher level of engagement and potential for increased revenue.

Recommendations:
1. Increase brand visibility on other e-commerce platforms by leveraging existing customer reviews and implementing effective ad campaigns.
2. Promote the brand with compelling offers and unique, high-quality products, especially during festival seasons. Align promotions with emotional and festive sentiments to resonate with customers.
3. Launch combo offers such as multi-color costumes or sets of 2 or 3 costumes with varying styles and colors. This encourages customers to explore different dress options and increases the likelihood of multiple purchases.
4. Highlight ethnic dresses through e-commerce advertisements, showcasing unique designs to boost the purchase of ethnic costumes.
